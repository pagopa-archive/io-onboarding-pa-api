# IO Onboarding portal backend

This repository contains the code of the backend application of the IO Public
Administrations onboarding portal.

## What is IO?

More informations can be found on the [IO project website](https://io.italia.it).

## Prerequisites

- [Bash](https://www.gnu.org/software/bash/) or [GitBash](https://gitforwindows.org/)
- [Docker](https://www.docker.com/)
- [Docker Compose](https://github.com/docker/compose)

### Dependencies

In order to test the backend locally, aside the backend NodeJS process,
some services must be up and running:

- [SPID test environment](https://github.com/italia/spid-testenv2)
- [PostgreSQL](https://postgresql.org) for data persistence
- [MailHog] smtp server (to test emails)

All these services starts automatically running docker-compose.

#### Optional environment variables

The table lists the optional environment variables: if any of them is not set,
the application will use its default value instead.

| Variable name                       | Description                                                             | type   | default |

## Production deployments

An Azure pipeline is configured by the IO adminstrators
to run on each push on the master branch.

Each time a change is merged, a corresponding Docker image is automatically created on
[DockerHub](https://cloud.docker.com/u/teamdigitale/repository/docker/teamdigitale/io-onboarding-pa-api).

The image is then deployed on Kubernetes clusters using a dedicated helm-chart;
see the [production deployment repository](https://github.com/teamdigitale/io-infrastructure-post-config).

The deployed backend is reachable at
[https://api.pa-onboarding.dev.io.italia.it/]https://api.pa-onboarding.dev.io.italia.it/).

## Test the application locally

To build the application and starts the services, run from the project root:

```shell
cp env.example .env
# edit .env
docker-compose up -d postgresql
docker-compose up
```

> The _docker-compose.yaml_ file sources variables from a _.env_ file that must be
> placed in the root folder of this repository. An example file _env.example_ is
> distributed with the code.

The backend REST APIs can be now accessed at
[http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000).

To rebuild the software and see changes:

```shell
docker-compose up --build
```

### Skip docker

If you run a suitable environment (ie. a Linux machine with NodeJS and yarn installed),
you can avoid using docker and run the backend application directly.

First, install [nvm](https://github.com/nvm-sh/nvm),
NodeJS and [Yarn](https://yarnpkg.com/lang/en/).

```shell
nvm install $(< .node-version)
nvm use $(< .node-version)
yarn install
yarn watch
```

Remember that in this setup you must connect the application
to a running PostgreSQL instance and a configured SPID test environment.

You may try with a hybrid setup starting these services using docker-compose
before running the backend since ports are exposed by default:

```shell
# change .env *_HOST settings to point to localhost then run
docker-compose up -d postgresql spid-testenv2 mailhog
```

### Modify SPID Service Provider certificates

To create new certificates, run the command

```shell
rm certs/*
yarn generate-test-certs
```

Then, start the containers using _docker-compose_ and point your browser to
[http://localhost:3000/metadata](http://localhost:3000/metadata). You should now
manually replace the content of the _testenv2/conf/sp_metadata.xml_ file with
the output of this page.

To complete the configuration, remove from the _testenv2/conf/sp_metadata.xml_
file the `<EncryptionMethod>` elements, and add between the elements
`<KeyDescriptor>` and `<NameIDFormat>` the following tag:

```xml
<SingleLogoutService
   Binding="urn:oasis:names:tc:SAML:2.0:bindings:HTTP-POST"
   Location="http://localhost:3000/spid/logout" />
```

Finally, run `docker-compose restart` and start using the backend application
with the new certificates.

## Test the login with SPID

SPID test users attributes and credentials are listed
in the page [http://localhost:8088/users](http://localhost:8088/users).

Two users are created by default:

- _pippo_ / _test_
- _pinco_ / _test_

To validate SPID login functionalities, point your browser to
[http://localhost:3000/login?entityID=xx_testenv2&authLevel=SpidL2](http://localhost:3000/login?entityID=xx_testenv2&authLevel=SpidL2)
and use the login credentials of one of the SPID test users configured.
